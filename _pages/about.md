Hi, I'm Ziyi 👋, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, fortunately advised by [Prof. Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/) at [NEU HAI] Lab (https://hailab.io/). My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular focus on large language model (LLM) agents. 🤖

Prior to joining Northeastern, I got my bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology and master's degree in Electronic Information from Tsinghua University. During my master's studies, I worked in the [MSIIP](http://msiip.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Ji Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1V8LxbYAAAAJ&hl=en).

This is my cat🐱CakeCake, a curious scientist in her own right. She's the reason I work hard — to earn her cat food.
