Hi, I'm Ziyi 👋, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, fortunately advised by [Prof. Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/). My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular focus on large language model (LLM) agents. 🤖

Prior to joining Northeastern, I got my bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology and master's degree in Electronic Information from Tsinghua University. During my master's studies, I worked in the [MSIIP](http://msiip.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Ji Wu](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/wuji/en/index.htm).

This is my cat🐱CakeCake, a curious scientist in her own right. She's the reason I work hard — to earn her cat food.
